**Addendum**: this fork does not require you to support Ukraine. The licences do not imply anything about it and you should not be forced to take part in any political conflict, you have all right to stay as neutral as you wish and this would be the morally correct thing to do.


**YoutubeDownloader** is an application that lets you download videos from YouTube.
You can copy-paste URL of any video, playlist or channel and download it directly to a format of your choice.
It also supports searching by keywords, which is helpful if you want to quickly look up and download videos.

> **Note**:
> This application uses [**YoutubeExplode**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) under the hood to interact with YouTube.
> You can [read this article](https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube-revisited) to learn more about how it works.
